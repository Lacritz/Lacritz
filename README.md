### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gJiHEKslqhGDjCKj7R/giphy.gif" width="50"> _Hi there..._

I'm Timo, a passionated full stack developer and freelance software engineer. You can find me primarily working in the Backend, DevOps or coding new developer productivity tools. My passion goes with working on productivity tools, helping developers to concentrate on writing good code, without bothering too much with the build system, or general environment setup.

I've founded DataLbry in 2021 to revolutionize data integration and make it affordable for any company. Due to unforeseeable  circumstances (at least for me), I had to pause the product development for the very moment.

If you want to keep in touch with me, or if you have any interesting opportunity, a challenging freelance project, or if you simply want to have a chat checkout my contact information below.
